Feature: Include people affected by "RegistrationStatusIncludedUPDATE" and "RegistrationPersonalREAD" permissions (extension of Manage_people_affected.feature)

  Background:
    Given a logged-in user with the "RegistrationREAD" permission
    Given the "active phase" is "review inclusion" or "payment"

  Scenario: View people affected connected to a program
    Given scenario "View people affected connected to a program" in Manage_people_affected.feature
    Then also for each person a "Name" is shown
    And for each person the other "personal data attributes" connected to this program are shown ("Phone number", ...)
    And for each person the chosen "Financial Service Provider" is shown
    And for each person an "Included" date+time is shown (if already available)
    And for each person a "Rejected" date+time is shown (if already available)
    And for each person a "Inclusion ended" date+time is shown (if already available)

  Background:
    Given a logged-in user with the "RegistrationStatusIncludedUPDATE" and "RegistrationPersonalREAD" permissions
    Then the "include for program" action is visible

  Scenario: Use bulk-action "include for program"
    Given the generic "select bulk action" scenario (see Manage_people_affected.feature)
    When user selects the "include for program" action
    Then the eligible rows are those with status "registered", "selected for validation" and "validated" and "rejected" and "inclusion ended"

  Scenario: Confirm "include for program" action
    Given the generic "confirm apply action" scenario (see Manage_people_affected.feature)
    When the "bulk action" is "include for program"
    Then the "changed data" is that the "included" timestamp is filled for the selected rows
    And the "rejected" date+time remains visible, if the PA was "rejected" before
    And the "inclusion ended" date+time remains visible, if the PA had status "inclusion ended" before
    And the "status" is updated to "Included"
    And if the custom SMS option is used, an SMS is sent to the PA (see Manage_people_affected.feature)
    And in the PA-app a notification appears that the PA is included

  Scenario: Include 2000 PAs
    Given there are 2000 "registered" PAs in the system (see Admin-user/Import_test_registrations_NL.feature)
    When the user uses and confirms the "include for program" action on all 2000 PAs
    Then this is all processed as in the scenario above, quickly and without problem
